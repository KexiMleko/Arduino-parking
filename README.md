IotParking: Smart Parking Spot Detection System

This IoT-based system detects available parking spots using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors, transmitting real-time data to a central server.
The backend is built with ASP.NET Core (IotParking.Api), while the frontend is an Angular web app (IotParking.ClientApp) for live monitoring.
A lightweight bridge application (IotParking.Bridge) forwards sensor data from the Arduino to the backend via serial communication.
The goal is to demonstrate a low-cost, scalable solution for smart city parking management and data visualization.
